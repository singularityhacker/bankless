                        <p><strong><i>The most widely-held social token</i></strong></p>
                        <p>BANK is the native token of BanklessDAO. As a tool for the Bankless community, it determines membership level and voting power in on-chain votes. To be a Level 1 member, which means you can access the Discord server without needing a guest pass, you must hold 35,000 BANK.</p>
                        <p>BANK is available on both Uniswap and Sushiswap and can be earned by working in the DAO. Many guest pass holders earn their 35,000 BANK rather than buy it outright. </p>

                        <p><strong><i>The only index that can get ETH and BTC maxis in BED together</i></strong></p>
                        <p>The Bankless BED Index is a passive investment vehicle weighted equally in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the DeFi Pulse Index (DPI), which tracks high-usage DeFi assets. This index gives you exposure to crypto without having to research DeFi projects or constantly rebalance your portfolio. This is a great first crypto investment for anyone just starting their crypto journey. The fund is a cooperation between BanklessDAO and Index Coop, a provider of DeFi investment products. </p>

                        <p>The Bankless DeFi Innovation Index, called the GMI Index for the rally cry “we’re all gonna make it,” is another investment vehicle springing from the Index Coop/BanklessDAO partnership. Like the BED Index, GMI captures a broad swath of DeFi exposure while also tapping into gains from sophisticated products such as yield-bearing tokens. </p>

                        <p>DAOpunks launched in 2021 with the mission of helping to free all humans from the soul-sucking drudgery of default world work. They do that work through providing grants to those who seek to leave the CORPrat life for the meaningful work found in DAOs. </p>
                        <p>Holders of a DAOpunk NFT enjoy access to gated channels, but the community is open to anyone with an interest in DAOs. In addition to grants, the DAOpunks have a newsletter, podcast, and merch arm, and are always spinning new ideas into actionable content. DAOpunks is at the edge of DAO governance, and is pushing the boundaries of where technology meets on-chain voting and automatic treasury triggers. </p>
